CMS FOR GO is a headless CMS (Content Management System) written in Golang, designed to be fast, efficient, and easily extensible. It allows you to
create a website or blog, with any template you like, in only a few
commands.

## Features 

- **Headless Architecture:** Adding pages, posts, or forms should all
  be done with easy requests to the API.
- **Golang-Powered:** Leverage the performance and safety of one of the
  best languages in the market for backend development.
- **SQL Database Integration:** Store your posts and pages in SQL databases for reliable and scalable data storage.

## Installation

Ensure you have Golang installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

```bash
go get -u github.com/username/CMSGO
```

## Example - Running the App

After you\'ve replaced the default template files with your prefered
template, simply build and start the app with the following commands.

```bash
go build
./cms-for-go
```

This will start CMS FOR GO on `http://localhost:8080`. You can customize
the configuration by providing the necessary environment variables.

For more information, see the [configuration settings](#configuration).

## Dependencies

CMSGO relies on the following Golang dependencies:

- [Gin](github.com/gin-gonic/gin) as the web framework for Golang.
- [ZeroLog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog) for logging.

## Configuration

The runtime configuration is handled through reading the
necessary environment variables. This approach was chosen as
it makes integrating `envfile`s quite easy.

The following list outlines the environment variables needed.

- `CMSGO_DATABASE_ADDRESS` should contain the database addres,
  e.g. `localhost`.
- `CMSGO_DATABASE_PORT` should be the connection port to the
  database. For example `3306`.
- `CMSGO_DATABASE_USER` is the database username.
- `CMSGO_DATABASE_PASSWORD` needs to contain the database
  password for the given user.
